Please use the excel sheet in this folder with the code to reproduce results.
Be ware that two columns were omitted from the original excel sheet. This is because
the PCA analysis showed these to be outliers. Therefore, if you run the PCA analysis again
on the current excel sheet, no outliers will be detected.

Thank you!
